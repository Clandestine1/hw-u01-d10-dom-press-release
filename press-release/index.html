General Assembly has an ambitious vision for the future. We are working toward a world in which we can close the global skills gap, ensuring that everyone; regardless of social or economic barriers, has access to the training they need to pursue a career they love. To achieve this goal, we work closely with employers to understand the workforce they need, and then empower students and employees with these skills.
